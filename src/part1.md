<span class="drop">A</span> few months ago, as part of a project we’re calling [Education Lab IQ](http://www.seattletimes.com/education-lab/readers-choose-our-first-education-lab-iq-question-for-us-to-answer/), we asked readers what questions they wanted us to answer. Sharon Vashon asked: What does it mean to fully fund education as required by the state Supreme Court’s McCleary decision? 

More specifically, she asked: “What is the bottom line, and how does that translate to staff and programs?”

Turns out, she is not the only one wondering about that. We asked you which reader question we should answer and her query won, hands down. 

The answer to Vashon’s question is complicated, with &mdash; not surprisingly &mdash; a lot of politics involved. 

That’s because there isn’t a magic number that lawmakers agree they have to hit.
  
Why? Well, that’s a long story. And first we have to understand some of the history of this state’s battle over school funding.
