The Legislature came back Jan. 11 for a short session, which ends March 10.

What have they achieved so far this year?

The plaintiffs say not much &mdash; just a plan to make a plan on how to raise school spending by 2018.  Lawmakers aren’t even talking about how to solve some of the hardest questions raised by the McCleary decision &mdash; especially what to do with all the local levies that school districts now use to supplement inadequate financing from the state. Should those go away?  Become part of state funding?  

One group of representatives believes there’s still a lot of confusion about what the McCleary decision requires because it’s not clear what percentage of basic education needs are currently being covered by local levies. In February, the Legislature approved a bill that calls for a study of that question.

So when do all these conversations, debates, hemming and hawing need to be wrapped up?

If you can believe it, that was also up for debate until recently, although now it looks like the Legislature has agreed to finding a solution by April 2017, the end of the next legislative session. 

And what happens if that deadline isn’t met? Or if the state Supreme Court decides to force action sooner?  

Good question.
