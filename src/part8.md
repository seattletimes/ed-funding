The Legislature came back Jan. 11 for a short session, which ends March 10.

What have they achieved so far this year?

The plaintiffs say not much &mdash; just a plan to make a plan on how to raise school spending by 2018.  Lawmakers aren’t even talking about how to solve some of the hardest questions raised by the McCleary decision &mdash; especially what to do with all the local levies that school districts now use to supplement inadequate financing from the state. Should those go away?  Become part of state funding?  

A majority of lawmakers say there’s still a lot of confusion about what the McCleary decision requires because it’s unclear what percentage of basic education needs are currently being covered by local levies. On Feb. 29, 2016, the governor <span class="yellow"><a href="http://www.governor.wa.gov/news-media/inslee-signs-first-bill-session-ensures-continued-bipartisan-collaboration-education">signed a bill into law</a></span> that will create a task force to study that question. The group will also create recommendations about teacher compensation and limits on school levies.  
 
So when do all these conversations debates, hemming and hawing need to be wrapped up?
 
If you can believe it, that was also up for debate until recently. It now looks like lawmakers have agreed to find a solution by the end of the next legislative session, which is supposed to end in April 2017 but could run longer.
 
And what happens if that deadline isn’t met? Or if the state Supreme Court decides to force action sooner? 
 
Good question.
