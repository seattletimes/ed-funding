<span class="drop">S</span>o under the 2012 McCleary decision, the Supreme Court once again ordered to fully fund a basic education for Washington’s schoolchildren. But what’s basic?  

As we’ve said, the constitution doesn’t define what basic means. That’s the Legislature’s responsibility, and that definition has changed over time. In fact, in the McCleary decision, the justices wrote that “the program of basic education is not etched in constitutional stone” and that it’s the Legislature’s job “to review the basic education program as the needs of students and the demands of society evolve.” 

The last time lawmakers updated their definition was in 2009, with a bill called <span class="yellow"><a href="http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2009-10/Pdf/Bill%20Reports/House/2261-S.E%20HBR%20FBR%2009.pdf">ESHB 2261.</a></span>

The debate over that bill was a spirited one &mdash; in part because changing the definition is a financial commitment. If something falls under basic education, it has to be completely funded by the state, even during tough economic times. If something isn’t considered  basic, the state can set it aside for a time, or stop funding it altogether. 

Here’s what’s basic, based on the 2009 law’s additions:

<div class="block-box">
  <div class="block">
    <div class="hed"><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> Learning tools</div>
    <ul>
      <li>Books, computers and other supplies 
  </div>

  <div class="block">
    <div class="hed"><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> Learning environment</div>
    <ul>
      <li>A full day of kindergarten (new in 2009; before that it was a half-day) 
      <li>No more than 17 students per certificated staff member in grades K-3. <em>(This is commonly referred to as “class size.” But it’s important to understand that the actual requirement is a ratio of students to all certificated instructional staff, which includes teachers, librarians, counselors, health services staff and others.)</em>
      <li>A district-wide average of 1,080 hours of instruction for each school year for high school students, and at least 1,000 hours for grades K-8
      <li>At least 180 days of school each year
      <li>The opportunity to earn 24 credits to earn a high-school diploma.
      <li>Bus transportation for students who live more than one to two miles from school, depending on the grade level 
  </div>

  <div class="block">
    <div class="hed"><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> School and district staff</div>
    <ul>
      <li>Qualified teachers paid a competitive salary
      <li>Other qualified school staff &mdash; like librarians, counselors, custodians, security guards, principals &mdash; paid a competitive salary
      <li>A central office staff that supports schools 
  </div>

  <div class="block">
    <div class="hed"><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> Learning programs</div>
    <ul>
      <li>Special education to help students with disabilities  
      <li>Bilingual program for students who need help learning English  
      <li>Remedial education for students who fall behind
      <li>An accelerated or enriched learning program for students who qualify. These are often referred to as highly capable programs.  
      <li>An educational program for students who are in a juvenile-detention center,  a state institution or a residential school
  </div>
</div>

Some of these things are old. Some are new &mdash; such as smaller class sizes in grades K-3 and a full day of kindergarten.  

More important, what’s also changed in the past few years is how the Legislature allocates money to pay for all of the above.  

Before we go on, one important note: Districts have a lot of leeway in how to spend the money they get from the state and federal government. So just because something is on the basic education list above, that doesn’t mean every single district spends its money exactly that way. Also, lawmakers haven’t yet allocated money for some of these things because they set themselves the deadline of 2018 to provide it &mdash; we’ll come back to that point in a second.
