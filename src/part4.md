<span class="drop">“L</span>evy” is a wonky word for what’s essentially a tax that’s assessed, or levied, on the value of a taxpayer’s property.  Here’s an example of how levies work: A school district has to heat its buildings so students and teachers don’t freeze in the winter. Let’s say that costs $1,000 per school per year. But let’s also say the price of oil increases, therefore heating costs increase, and now the district has to pay $2,000 to heat each school. But the state doesn’t take the rising cost of oil into account. It continues to give just $1,000 to heat a school, even though nothing is more basic than a warm classroom. So how does a district cover the extra cost?  Through local property tax levies, which technically are only supposed to be used for extra things like extracurricular activities or extra class periods in high school.

Districts have long asked voters to approve local levies, and then dipped into levy funds when state support for costs like heat, school supplies, buses and teacher salaries fell short. 

As we mentioned, back in the 1970s, the state lost another school funding case and was forced to put more money toward schools.  Around the same time, the Legislature also passed the Levy Lid Act, which placed a limit on how much school districts could raise through local levies.  Those levies, which had made up about 24 percent of school funding, dropped to about 8 percent.

But over time, levies have started to creep up again.

So why is this a problem?

Local levies create a divide between richer and poorer districts because richer districts can more easily raise money from their taxpayers than poorer districts. That means some districts can fill in where the state falls short, and others can’t.  

The constitution also says public schools in this state should have a reliable source of funding &mdash; and levies aren’t reliable because voters don’t always approve them, so school districts can’t count on levy money. 

But since the late 1970s, districts slowly have started to ask voters for more and more in levy funds &mdash; as costs, like the oil in our example, continued to increase. The Legislature let this happen &mdash; and in fact passed several bills allowing school districts to exceed  the 1977 levy lid. Local levies now make up roughly 25 percent of many district’s budgets &mdash; filling in gaps in the state’s support for costs like heating, teacher salaries, busing, books and copy paper.

It’s not fair&mdash; but what choice do districts have?
