What will all this cost?

The short answer: We don’t know.

Since the McCleary case was filed in 2007, this is roughly how much the state has spent per pupil. 
(The state doesn’t keep track of exactly how much it spends per pupil. Rather it keeps track of state general fund revenues, or how much money school districts receive from the state. The total state revenues per pupil are a good proxy for total state spending per pupil.)

This money from the state isn’t all districts spend &mdash; they also get money from local property taxes and the federal government. That increased total per-pupil funding to $10,977 in the 2014-15 school year, which probably keeps Washington below the national average.  

Everyone agrees that, under the McCleary decision, the state needs to pay more &mdash; a lot more &mdash; and by 2018 at the latest. How much? That’s a matter of debate, too.

In August 2015, the Supreme Court justices singled out a handful of basic education costs and commented on the progress the Legislature has made so far: 

<div class="block">
  <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> Materials, supplies and other operating costs: Fully funded
</div>
<div class="block">
  <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> Transportation to and from school: Fully funded
</div>
<div class="block">
  <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> Full-day kindergarten: Fully funded, though more money is needed to build enough classrooms and employ enough teachers so all districts can offer a full day.
</div>
<div class="block">
  <i class="fa fa-square-o"></i> Reducing the number of students per class in grades K-3: Some progress, but not on track to meet 2018 deadline &mdash; and there is a lack of funding for extra classrooms and to find enough teachers. 
</div>
<div class="block">
  <i class="fa fa-square-o"></i> Market-rate staff compensation: No progress
</div>

And because the Legislature hadn’t made substantial progress, the court ordered fines of  $100,000 a day until lawmakers at least wrote a plan for how they would fulfill the promises they  have made when it comes to basic education.   

So how much will it cost to provide school staff with competitive salaries, reduce K-3 class sizes, and build enough classrooms to offer those smaller classes and a full day of kindergarten?

It depends on whom you ask. Here are some examples: 

 
* According to some in the Legislature, the major remaining cost is staff compensation and that will cost at least $3.5 billion per biennium based on a June 2015 fiscal analysis &mdash; or about $1.76 billion a year.  
* The Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction estimates it would cost at least $7.6 billion every biennium &mdash; or about $3.8 billion a year. That number doesn’t factor in capital costs, which would be separate.
* Eden Mack, a leader in Washington’s Paramount Duty group, says the number is closer to $8 billion more per biennium for operations, or $4 billion a year &mdash; and that doesn’t count a one-time cost of $2 billion to build new classrooms to lower class sizes and support all-day kindergarten. She based her estimate on the state’s testimony from the McCleary case. 
* Tom Ahearne, the lawyer representing the plaintiffs in the McCleary case, agrees with Eden Mack that it will cost at least $8 billion more per biennium, plus an additional $2 billion in capital costs for new K-3 classrooms and all-day kindergarten. But he also thinks the minimum should include two other things: First, cost-of-living increases for school staff, which a legislative working group has recommended. (And voters approved years ago, but lawmakers have not funded most years.) Second, other capital expenses, like renovating school buildings that are falling apart. He’s not sure how many additional dollars the cost-of-living raises and the other capital costs would add up to.

Why do the estimates differ so dramatically? The state Supreme Court’s job is to enforce the constitution, not write state budgets. That’s why the court hasn’t dictated a dollar amount for funding McCleary and why phrases like “fully funding education” and “paramount duty” are left up to interpretation. 

For example, remember HB 2261, the bill that defined basic education? That bill created the Quality Education Council, a committee of education leaders and policymakers who were supposed to update the definition of “basic education” and recommend how to fund it. The Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction has based most of its estimate on the recommendations from that council. But the Legislature, with its estimate of $3.5 billion, has mostly ignored the council’s numbers, and instead has run its own fiscal analysis.  

Also, OSPI’s estimate includes the costs of Initiative 1351, which voters approved in November 2014. That measure requires lower class sizes in all grades, and ramping up education spending in a number of other ways, too. In July 2015, legislators said they were unable to find the $2 billion it would cost to fund the measure, so they’ve put it on hold for the time being and don’t count it in their calculations of how much it will cost to fully fund education. Neither do   
Mack and Ahearne, because I-1351 didn’t exist when the McCleary case was decided.
