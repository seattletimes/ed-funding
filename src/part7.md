<span class="drop">W</span>hat will all this cost? The short answer: We don’t know. 

But let’s start with what the state has been spending since 2007, the year the McCleary case was filed. Here’s the picture since then, after adjusting for inflation. And you can see that the Legislature has made some progress, given the larger number in 2014-15.

<strong>Spending per pupil (adjusted for inflation):</strong>

(One note about these numbers: The state doesn’t keep track of exactly how much is spent per pupil. Rather it keeps track of state general fund revenues, or how much money school districts receive from the state. The total state revenues per pupil are a good proxy for total state spending per pupil.)

This money from the state isn’t all districts spend &mdash; they also get money from local property taxes and the federal government. That increased total per-pupil funding to $10,977 in the 2014-15 school year, which probably keeps Washington below the national average.

Everyone agrees that, under the McCleary decision, the state needs to pay more &mdash; a lot more &mdash; and by 2018 at the latest. How much? That’s a matter of debate, too.

In August 2015, the Supreme Court justices <span class="yellow"><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2272557-84362-7-8-13-2015-mccleary-order.html">singled out a handful of basic education costs and commented on the progress</a></span> the Legislature has made so far:

And because the Legislature hadn’t made substantial progress, the court ordered fines of  <span class="yellow"><a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/education/supreme-court-orders-100000-per-day-fines-in-mccleary-case/">$100,000 a day</a></span> until lawmakers at least wrote a plan for how they would fulfill the promises they  have made when it comes to basic education.

          Tom Ahearne, the lawyer representing the plaintiffs in the McCleary case, agrees with Eden Mack that it will cost at least $8 billion more per biennium, plus an additional $2 billion in capital costs for new K-3 classrooms and all-day kindergarten. But he also thinks the minimum should include two other things: First, cost-of-living increases for school staff, which a legislative working group has recommended. (And voters approved years ago, but lawmakers have not funded most years.) Second, other capital expenses, like renovating school buildings that are falling apart. He’s not sure how many additional dollars the cost-of-living raises and the other capital costs would add up to.

          Eden Mack, a leader in Washington’s Paramount Duty group, <span class="yellow"><a href="http://paramountduty.com/faq/">says the number is closer to $8 billion more per biennium</span></a> for operations, or $4 billion a year &mdash; and that doesn’t count a one-time cost of $2 billion to build new classrooms to lower class sizes and support all-day kindergarten. She based her estimate on the state’s testimony from the McCleary case.

          The Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction <span class="yellow"><a href="http://www.k12.wa.us/Communications/FullyFundPlan/PlanCostTable.pdf">estimates</span></a> it would cost at least $7.6 billion every biennium &mdash; or about $3.8 billion a year.

          According to some in the Legislature, the major remaining cost is staff compensation and that will cost at least $3.5 billion per biennium based on a <span class="yellow"><a href="https://app.leg.wa.gov/CMD/Handler.ashx?MethodName=getdocumentcontent&documentId=ylJ1VjThL5g&att=false">June 2015 fiscal analysis</span></a> &mdash; or about $1.76 billion a year.

Why do the estimates differ so dramatically? The state Supreme Court’s job is to enforce the constitution, not write state budgets. That’s why the court hasn’t dictated a dollar amount for funding McCleary and why phrases like “fully funding education” and “paramount duty” are left up to interpretation. 

For example, remember HB 2261, the bill that defined basic education? That bill created the Quality Education Council, a committee of education leaders and policymakers who were supposed to make recommendations on how to put the new definition of basic education into practice. The Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction has based most of its estimate on the recommendations from that council. But the Legislature, with its estimate of $3.5 billion, has mostly ignored the council’s numbers, and instead has run its own fiscal analysis.  

Also, OSPI’s estimate includes the costs of Initiative 1351, which voters approved in November 2014. That measure requires lower class sizes in all grades, and ramping up education spending in a number of other ways, too. In July 2015, legislators said they were unable to find the $2 billion it would cost to fund the measure, so they’ve put it on hold for the time being and don’t count it in their calculations of how much it will cost to fully fund education. Neither do Mack and Ahearne, because I-1351 didn’t exist when the McCleary case was decided.
